== Description ==

This simple weather plugin will help you quickly add a weather snippet directly inside your posts and pages using WordPress shortcodes.

Major features in this plugin include:

* Automatic weather feeds from OpenWeatherMaps.com
* Feeds from any City in USA/UK
* Select between Fahrenheit and Celsius
* Choose one of many themes
* Add rounded corners or a border with a snap 

PS: You'll need an [OpenWeatherMap.com API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in) to use it. A default key has been installed into the plugin for preview purposes, but should not be used excessively so as to avoid API overuse.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to your blog, Activate it, then enter your settings from within the WP Settings tab.

After you have completed your settings, from within any post or page editor, create a new WP shortcode [stevesweather]. That's it! Your weather will now appear as you set it up from within your post.
